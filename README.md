# p4g64.socialStatTracker
(Also on gamebanana:) 

Displays how many points you need to rank up each social stat in the status menu. Also displays how many points over the maximum you have for each maxed social stat up to 999 points by default. (Can be toggled in config)

An additional config option to display the points earned / points required text above the social stat instead of below it is also available. This is enabled by default. Please disable it if you prefer bottom rendering!

Unlike P5R, where social stats are not capped. P4G caps at 999 for each stat, the same as P3P.

Note that the number of points earned at any point can be measured by the type of message shown. They're grouped as follows:

- Increased = 1-3 points
- Greatly increased = 4-5 points
- Significantly increased = 6+

For example: "Your Diligence has greatly increased" means you've gained between 4-5 points inclusive.
