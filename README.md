# p4g64.socialStatTracker
(Also on..) Displays how many more points you need to rank up each social stat in the status menu. Also displays how many points over max you have for any maxed social stats up to 999 points (can be toggled in the config).

In regards to seeing the number of points over max you have, unlike P5R where the game does not cap the amount you can get, in P4G it is capped to 999 points (?) for each stat (gaining any more will do nothing). That means that the maximum you can get is +769 for academics, +899 for charm, and +919 for courage.

Note that the number of points you get at any point can be estimated by the end of the message shown. The messages are grouped as follows:
- Increased = 1-2 points
- Greatly increased = 3-5 points
- Significantly increased = 6+ points

For example: "Your Courage has greatly increased" means you've gained between 3 and 5 courage points inclusive.
